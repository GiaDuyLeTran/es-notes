        <div class="notes">A typical Embedded System with decent computing power may draw 10-20W or roughly 1-2A at 12V. This makes it a good input voltage for the system, as 1-2A is easily able to be carried along the small wires from a plug pack to the device.</div>

        <div class="notes">5V was historically the right voltage to drive silicon transistor-based logic. As transistors got better, the required drive voltages decreased but 5V has stayed a common voltage. It is used many systems that connect directly to USB, as it is the supplied voltage of choice there.

        In automotive applications, there is often quite a bit of noise and this can be interpretted as signal for lower-voltage systems. As such, 5V is still common there as well.</div>

The parallel configuration here is useful if the lower voltage draws significant current as in a series configuration, the higher voltages need to supply the current for their own rails <b>plus</b> the lower voltage rails.

        All regulators have different startup times - times from the voltage being applied to the output voltage being correct.  If the regulators are in parallel, this can cause issues. In the example case, the 3.3V regulator is turned on slightly before the 5V regulator.</div>

        During startup, there will be a period when the 3.3V line is up and the 5V rail is still at 0V.

        During this period, the high protection diode on the input of the device is forward-biased, shorting 3.3V to ground.  If this condition lasts for long enough, the protection diode can be damaged, destroying the device.</div>

        <div class="notes">In practice, this means that the current in a PCB trace cannot change very quickly. Any attempt by a device on the board to suddenly draw more or less current will cause the voltage on that trace to rise and fall significantly.

        Here we are not worried about what happens when current falls and voltage rises, those spikes are generally taken care of by protection diodes on the parts. Of more interest is when current demand increases, voltage on the trace can fall dramatically.</div>

        <div class="notes">If the device draws a lot of current, the decoupling may have to be built in to the package of the device itself. This can be seen on the bottom of this Intel Pentium 4 processor.

        If the capacitor is too far away from the device drawing the power, the inductance of the trace between the capacitor and device will act to reduce the effect of having the capacitor there in the first place.

        Less obvious is that the capacitor itself has some inductance, mainly due to its leads or contacts, which can act to make it less useful. A good decoupling capacitor should be physically small to minimize these effects, but large capacitance to provide enough power.

        This dichotomy leads to the use of several decoupling capacitors on one device: A small, low value one close and one or more physically and electrically-larger ones as you move further away from the device.
