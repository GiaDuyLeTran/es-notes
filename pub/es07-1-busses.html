        <div class="notes">The application layer is the uppermost in the stack.
Conceptually this means that it shouldn’t carry data on behalf of another protocol. Application layer protocols are things like HTTP, NTP etc. They are ‘final products’.

Some application protocols have been subverted to carry other protocols; for example, web applications use HTTP to carry data associated with other protocols e.g. JSON which is in fact a presentation layer protocol itself.</div>

This layer is rarely implemented separately from the application layer, as the presentation of data is dependent on the data itself which in turn is heavily dependent on what the application’s actually trying to say.</div>

There isn’t much that seems logical about IP addresses, but in fact they’re hierarchical identifiers that originally could location particular machines in particular labs, companies, countries etc. As the number of computers wanting IP addresses outstripped the number actually available, this model was broken and the IP address is now pretty arbitrary.</div>

One master, many slaves. One ‘slave select’ line per slave (or ‘chip select’) provides addressing: Only the selected slave should receive and transmit data.

        <h1>I<sup>2</sup>C</h1>
        <center><img src="images/comm-mem/i2c.png" class="naked"></center>

        <div class="notes">More tightly standardized than SPI, it defines the required clock rate, a multi-master arbitration protocol and even the type of data to be transferred.

I2C was trademarked by Phillips, but rather than jump through licensing hoops, many manufacturers chose instead to implement exactly the same protocol but call it something different. A common alternative name to the same bus is ‘TWI’, the two-wire interface.</div>

        <p>Capacitance on the lines can cause an &ldquo;Opera House&rdquo; effect.</p>
        <div class="notes">I2C has two wires, a clock and a data line. As such, it is half duplex.

Both lines are ‘Open Drain’, which means that they are driven low but never driven high, instead, pull-up resistors must be fitted to the bus. This means that whenever nothing is explicitly pulling the lines low, the bus idles high.

The open drain design means that when ever a device expects the bus to be high, it must check this fact. If the bus isn’t in the expected state, this means that another device is driving the bus at the same time. Either this is another bus master fighting for the bus, or an expected slave acknowledgement.</div>

        <p>Every byte is acknowledged by the receiver, by means of pulling the data line low.</p>
        <p>This allows the master to confirm a slave is present and accepting data.</p>

        <div class="notes">In fact the ACK slot plays another role. If the master is reading from the slave, then the master will acknowledge the receipt of a byte if and only if it wishes to receive another.  That is, when the master is finished reading, it will not acknowledge the final byte.

            In this way, the lack of an acknowledge is not always an error condition.</div>

        <div class="notes">USB is by far the most commonly used interface for computer peripherals and devices, although its use in Embedded
Systems is somewhat limited. USB is fairly complex to implement and, though the spec allows for guaranteed bandwidth or latency allocations, few devices take advantage of this.</div>

    <div class="step" data-x='2100' data-y='1200' data-scale="0.5">
        <h2>Logical Connection</h2>
        <img src="images/comm-mem/usb-logical.png" class="naked">

        <div class="notes">Everyone is familiar with the architecture of USB, with devices connected through hubs in a tree structure.
Inside each physical device there are a number of logical ‘endpoints’. Endpoints in each device are logically connected by ‘pipes’.
There’s always a pipe between Endpoint 0 at each end, referred to as the Control Pipe. This carries set up information at start up, including information about how the other endpoints are to be wired up.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-x='2100' data-y='1400' data-scale="0.5">
        <h1>Pipe Types</h1>

        <div class="notes">Pipes between endpoints can either by message pipes, like the control pipe, or stream pipes. Stream pipes are used for most data transfers.  Stream pipes in turn are divided in to three classes: Interrupt, Isochronous and Bulk.

Stream pipes are unidirectional while message pipes are bi-directional.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-x='2000' data-y='1500' data-scale="0.5">

                <li>Used for streaming devices, e.g. USB Speakers</li></ul>
        </div></div>
        <div class="notes">Isochronous transfers can tolerate data loss more than they can tolerate latency. USB speakers, webcams and the like use Isochronous transfers.

Isochronous transfers have a guaranteed rate (which is generally, but not always, as fast as possible). This rate must be requested by the USB device when it is plugged in, in order for the OS to confirm that the guarantees can be satisfied. In order to make these guarantees, the computer must reserve the right to reject a device’s application for bandwidth; there isn’t an infinite amount of it around! In  ractice, it’s rare for one to try and connect so many webcams that the bandwidth is consumed and new devices get rejected, but it can happen.</div>

        </div></div>

        <div class="notes">Interrupt transfers can provide bounded latency assuming a complete knowledge of the devices on the bus and that all other devices are well-behaved.

Interrupt transfers are necessarily small amounts of data that must be delivered, such as information from USB mice and keyboards.</div>

        </div></div>

        <div class="notes">Bulk transfers take up the ‘rest’. Any bandwidth that isn’t reserved for the other two classes is allocated to bulk transfers. This is designed to be used by things like USB storage devices, but in practice many devices that should use other types end up using bulk transfers anyway. For example, a USB to Serial converter</div>

        <div class="notes">A common USB peripheral in Embedded Systems are “USB to Serial Converters”. These replace the standard serial ports that were present on most older computers with USB versions. This same concept is extended to “USB to I2C Converters”, “USB to
SPI” etc.

These devices cannot tolerate loss, they carry a lot of data; therefore they do not fit in to Isochronous or Interrupt categories. They use Bulk transfers.

Because they use bulk transfers, they have neither guaranteed latency or bandwidth. This means that an Embedded System using such a converter for communications can’t make any real time guarantees about delivery. In practice, the simple act of plugging in a mouse can ruin your communications channel.</div>

        <div class="notes">USB also specifies an amount of power that must be available to a down-stream device through the connector.
A device must draw no more than 500mA from a USB 1.x or 2.0 port or 900mA from a USB 3.0 port, all at 5 volts.

USB 3.0 includes power delivery up to 100W to allow for a single connector on a laptop carrying all docking signals, including battery charging.

This simple requirement has meant that USB is specified as more than a communications bus, many devices use it just for power!</div>
