        <h2>Embedded Systems</h2>

            <li>Low-performance</li>

            <li>Ubiquitous</li></ul></p>

        <div class="notes">Resource and performance constraints in Embedde Systems mean that they are relatively easy to overload and trigger denial-of-service events, crashes or timing overruns. Further, the low performance makes it likely that they will not perform high-end encryption.

        The firmware can be updated, which provides a vector by which an attacker may make their attack permanent. The frequency with which most users actually perform updates though is pretty low - when was the last time you updated the firmware in your modem/router? This often means that security problems can exist in devices for a long time after they're widely known.

        Embedded Systems are in charge of a wide range of high-value situations. An attacker may be able to take down power stations, public transport, traffic systems, factories etc. Embedded Systems are also entrusted with all the world's most trusted data through network switches, routers, gateways etc.</div>

        <h1>Threat Model</h1>

        <div class="notes">Before one can design a secure ES, one must know the threat that is going to be posed to it.  Casual hackers, untargetted attack, after data that your system doesn't even have?  Well-funded, state-sponsored attack with physical access to the devices?  They will all lead to very different responses.

        <h3>Security Objectives</h3>
        <ul><li>What level of security is required?</li>
            <li>What data is allowed to be lost?</li>
            <li>How much can the functionality be allowed to change?</li></ul>

        <div class="notes">A fully-secure system against all possible threats is at best expensive (at worst, impossible). The goal of the security review must be known from the first.  This is likely to be traded off against cost, usability etc as part of the overall system design.</div>

        <ul><li>What data of value does the system contain?</li>
            <li>What action of value does the system perform?</li>
            <li>Are &ldquo;soft assets&rdquo; such as reputation, trust an issue?</li></ul>

        <div class="notes">Product defacement for example may not have much of an impact on data or action but may weaken a brand's trust.</div>

        <div class="notes">The value of an asset (e.g. data) may not be immediately apparent. For example, a system that records POS transactions may have data that can leak a user's credit card details but if you collect data from several of these they can be used to track a user's movements; quite a different set of data of interest to quite a different class of potential attacker.</div>

        <h2>Change of Software</h2>
        <p><ul><li>Firmware update</li>
            <li>Permanent infection of executables or libraries</li></ul></p>
    </div>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='2650' data-y='400' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Can some (all) of your executable code be read-only?</h3>
        If all executable memory is read-only, then no infection can be permanent. The device may be power-cycled to restore original operation.
    </div>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='2850' data-y='400' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Can writeable memory (e.g. data, databases, files) change software behaviour?</h3>
        The answer is almost certainly <b>yes</b>. Potentially treat all data as untrusted and code defensively. Never assume that data is &ldquo;sane&rdquo;.
    </div>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='3050' data-y='400' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Does any data need to be stored in a non-volatile fashion?</h3>
        If all the data and code in your system is either non-volatile or read-only, then a power-cycle will remove any possible infection.

        <h3>How are your trusted users/computers identified?</h3>
        <p>Commonly username/password but this can be stolen.</p>
        <p>Two-factor authentication: Something you <b>have</b> and something you <b>know</b>. </p>
        <p>Computers often given <b>certificates</b> to prove identitiy. </p>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='2850' data-y='600' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>How is that authentication performed?</h3>
        <p>Can hack the process rather than the password.</p>
        <p>Passwords, authentication tokens can be changed. Biometric identity may be more secure against theft but when it is stolen, it is impossible to subsequently change.</p>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='3050' data-y='600' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Chain of Trust</h3>
        <p>Do you directly know and trust your users/computers?</p>
        <p>If not, do you know and trust someone who directly knows and trusts those users/computers?</p>
        <p>Do you trust all the intermediate computers/routers that the information will pass through?</p>
        <p>If not, can you protect (e.g. securely encrypt) the data so that it has no value to those intermediate computers?</p>
        <div class="notes">For example, you don't know what computer your bank will use to serve its online banking page. You have to trust a third-party to verify a particular computer is serving a particular page.  This is what the "untrusted certificate" messages you may see in your browser are all about: Don't ignore them!</div>

        <h2>Bug Triggers</h2>
        <p><ul><li>Used to change behaviour or facilitate other attacks</li>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='2650' data-y='800' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Do you have any untrusted data or interfaces?</h3>
        <p>Do you have to have those interfaces?</p>
        <div class="notes">The answer is almost certainly "yes". Your user may have to enter data in a text field, for example. At a more basic level, any data that comes through a communications link or stored in non-volatile storage may be corrupted to random values: No random value should be able to trigger misbehaviour.</div>
    </div>


    <div class="step thin" data-x='2850' data-y='800' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>How do you verify that trust?</h3>
        <p>Is data encrypted? How strong is that encryption?</p>
        <p>Is the encryption routine itself safe and bug-free?</p>
        <p>Are error-checking and identity-checking regimes in place to make sure data received is what was sent, and from who claims to have sent it?</p>

        <div class="notes">It's easy to see that a computer at the other end of a network link may need to have its identity verified when you receive data from it. What's less obvious is that maybe a local device has to have its identity checked too. A computer with a BadUSB stick connected may try and read or write to its hard drive but have that intercepted.  If the computer itself is infected with a virus (e.g. Stuxnet) then the act of reading and writing something may itself have been diverted; how can you guard against that?</div>

    <div class="step thin" data-x='3050' data-y='800' data-scale="0.25">
        <h3>Does your program treat these properly?</h3>
        <p>How do you know? Has your program been <b>fuzz-tested</b>?</p>
        <div class="notes">Fuzz-testing is the process of feeding a program a series of random or semi-random inputs over a long time and checking for misbehaviour. The complexity of modern software necessitates this kind of randomized testing as the number of different paths through the code may be too many to be checked by hand.</div>
