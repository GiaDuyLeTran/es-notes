            <li>Configurable</li>
            <li>Runs on more processors than any other kernel ever has (26 official at last count, many more unofficial)</li>

            <p>Named for the configuration option, it is a set of tweaks to Linux itself that improve RT behaviour.</p>

        <div class="notes">It was never designed for real time use, so applications in embedded systems must be approached with care. There are a number of efforts that have gone in to making Linux more suitable for hard real time tasks.

One approach is to run Linux inside another real time executive (RTLinux, RTAI). The less radical approach is found in the “PREEMPT_RT” work that is sponsored by many commercial embedded Linux vendors. Later in the lecture we will examine some examples of where this works and where it doesn’t.</div>

        <div class="notes">Processes are created on Linux using the clone() system call. More usually, the programmer will call fork() which uses clone internally. Fork creates what we would think of as Tasks, in that parent and child will not share memory once they’re running.

These functions are interesting: You call them once, they return twice. From the point of view of the parent, fork returns the process identifier of its new child. From the point of view of the child, fork returns zero.

Note that the example doesn't do any error checking, do not copy!</div>

        <div class="notes">Note the order of exit, the parent should wait for the child to die before exiting itself.
Why?
• It’s assumed the parent has started the child for a reason, it is usual for it to be around to see the results
• If the child doesn’t execute correctly, the parent presumably needs to know about it</div>

    <div class="step point" data-x='0' data-y='1650' data-scale="0.6">
    In Linux, if a parent doesn’t wait for a child to die, the child might become a <b>zombie</b> and never completely disappear. It waits around, using system resources indefinitely.

        <div class="notes">If the parent dies before the child, the orphan tasks are ‘re-parented’ to the init task in order to maintain a (semi-) sane process hierarchy.</div>

        <div class="notes">Forking doesn’t share memory from parent to child, so it can’t print 42, nor can ‘race’ with the parent thread to print some hybrid of 42 and 7.

It might make sense for the child to start with no variables, but in practice that’s ungainly and makes it difficult to perform tasks like setting up communication mechanisms between parent and child.

The child starts off with a value of i = 7 and that's what it prints.</div>

        <h1>CFS</h1>
        <div class="card">Models the <b>ideal</b> multithreading processor set on real hardware.</div>

        <div class="notes">CFS was written once the kernel had added support for High Resolution Timers, allowing actual task run time to be accounted for with nanosecond resolution, opening up new options for scheduling.

The operation of CFS can be summed up in a single sentence: CFS models the ideal multithreading processor set on real hardware.

Ideal multithreading hardware doesn’t exist, so it’s emulated on a real CPU quite simply: If two tasks of the same priority want to run, each should get 50% of the CPU.

Conceptually, the CPU should flick back and forwards between those two tasks as fast as possible so that neither is particularly favored over the other. Of course, in the real world, there must be some granularity here. (Why?)</div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-x='1000' data-y='1200' data-scale="0.6">
        <h2>Priority</h2>
        Splits CPU ratiometrically. Two tasks with the same priority will get the same share of the CPU. A task with double the priority of another will get double the share of the CPU.
        <h2>Heirarchy</h2>
        Can split the CPU ratiometrically on other things too; e.g. two <b>users</b> of the same priority get the same share of the CPU.  Within each User, processes can be scheduled as usual, appearing to run on a CPU half as powerful.
        <h2>Latency</h2>
        No guarantees on latency. Any process of any priority can preempt any other. The latency for a particular task to get CPU time is a function of the running behaviour of every other process on the system.

    <div class="step" data-x="2000" data-y="700" data-scale="0.6">
        <h1>Latency</h1>

        <h2><code>SCHED_RR, SCHED_FIFO</code></h2>
        <ul><li>The Kernel itself has many internal tasks, some of which have RT priority</li>
            <li>Kernel interrupt handlers are relatively large and not able to be preempted, even by RT processes</li>
            <li>Aggressive power management means that tasks are moved around available CPUs in order to best manage power. Migration to another CPU will almost certainly change the cache behaviour</li>
            <li>The kernel is full of complex interdependencies and locking that can’t be preempted</li>
            <li>Large portions of kernel code must be run with interrupts disabled, compounding the issues above.</li>
            <li>Linux may aggressively use frequency scaling and opportunistic suspend</li></ul>

        <div class="notes">Some of these issues are softened when using PREEMPT_RT kernels; most aren't.

An analysis of all the RT processes in the kernel is possible, but complex.

Opportunistic suspend is the act of putting the computer in to a deep sleep whenever it looks like no program is running. It is used a lot on mobile phones.</div>
