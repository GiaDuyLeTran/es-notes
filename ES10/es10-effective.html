        <h1>Measures of Success</h1>
        <p>Embedded Systems are designed and implemented to a specification to meet <b>technical</b> outcomes, but the success of the Embedded System though is defined with respect to <b>business</b> outcomes.</p>
        <p>The design of an Embedded System is to design a <b>technical solution to a business problem</b>.</p>

        <div class="notes">We all hope that our Embedded Systems are going to be successful, but what makes an Embedded System design and implementation successful?</div>

        Two equally important tasks:
        <ol><li>Producing a good technical solution to the specified problem</li>
            <li>Ensuring that the technical solution actually solves the business problem</li></ol>

        <div class="notes">As Engineers, the student would be forgiven for believing that their duty lies entirely in the creation of a technical solution and that any shortfall with respect to the business goals will be due to poor specification from the Business Analyst, Client Liaison etc.

        This is arguably true in theory, however in a small organisation the specification is likely to be drafted by the Engineer themselves. In larger organisations where a Business Analyst can and does draw the specification, it is rarely technically complete and the Engineer must be able to make choices that satisfy business goals.</div>

        <h1>Pitfalls</h1>

        <div class="notes">The ABC might be seen as competing with the System Engineering principles introduced through the rest of the degree, however this is not the case. The ABC is a minimal abstraction of the common elements of many other Systems Engineering processes, it’s the necessary and sufficient subset for our discussions.

        If a more detailed and formal process is required to implement the assessment of ‘Sales and Marketing Requirements’, draw out a ‘System Architecture’ etc., refer to a Systems text such as Blanchard and Fabricky."></div>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-x-rel="0" data-y-rel="100" data-scale="0.5">
    <p><b>Don’t examine industry requirements separately from the sales and marketing ones.</b></p>
    <p>Engineers may assume that the client is sufficiently well versed in the field to identify environmental targets, required interoperability, required manufacturing process etc. This is rarely the case, the client and Engineer should both identify (potentially) relevant standards and bring their research together during the stakeholder meeting.</p>
    </div>


    <div class="step" data-x-rel="0" data-y-rel="140" data-scale="0.5">
        <p><b>Focus on getting a good technical solution, assuming that such a solution will be of high quality.</b></p>
        <p>Quality goals should be an input to the technical design process, not a byproduct. Quality will almost certainly have to be traded off against other variables and the value of the trade will be set by business outcomes.</p>

        <p><b>Asking stakeholders to commit to positions during a single stakeholder meeting.</b></p>
        <p>An Engineer may not know whether something is technically possible off the top of their heads. Similarly, a marketer may not have all their client research to hand and a customer may have an impulse reaction to a concept quite different from if they think about it for a while. One of the most dangerous things in design is committing to something too early.</p>

        <h1>Trade-Offs</h1>

        <h3>Schedule, Time to Market</h3>
        <p>Always minimised within the other requirements.</p>

    <div class="step" data-x-rel="0" data-y-rel="200" data-scale="0.5">
        <h3>Capability</h3>
        <p>Should all features be implemented immediately or will some be held back to motivate a client upgrade later? Should the upgrade functionality be by unit replacement or firmware/software upgrade?</p>
        <p>Should multiple versions be offered with different capabilities, and what technical mechanism should control this?</p>
    </div>

    <div class="step" data-x-rel="0" data-y-rel="130" data-scale="0.5">
        <h3>Device Lifetime</h3>
        <p>Should the devices have a target lifetime that isn’t simply the maximum within the other bounds? For example, should a poor quality battery be used to motivate the client upgrading in the future?</p>

        <div class="notes">Capability and Device Lifetime are interesting in that they are technical parameters that may be primarily or directly driven by business requirements.

        Other requirements in this category might be portability (especially w.r.t software), availability, conformance to standards etc.</div>

        <h1>Prototyping</h1>
        The process of creating preliminary systems or subsystems in order to evaluate implementation options and feature sets.

        <div class="notes">The ABC defines a circular pattern, implying that there must be different stages of prototyping and testing.

It’s rare that a specification is complete and correct at the beginning of a project; the marketplace may change, a feature may be modified once it’s seen in action, new influences may be thought of and integrated. The specification is often a living document, although of course its life should be strictly controlled.

The key to keeping the specification evolving in a sensible way is to control the prototyping and testing of the system. Prototyping is the process of making preliminary systems, or parts of systems, in order to evaluate particular options for implementation. Minimising the number of prototype cycles is often seen as an effective way to minimise cost, however it is often a false economy as the end product may fall short of requirements.</div>

        <div class="notes">A common functional prototype for Embedded Systems is to use an off the shelf hardware design and simulated peripherals to allow software development to commence.

An example would be the use of an off the shelf consumer tablet as a development system for a touchscreen medical device, even though the final system will be unlikely to share the same hardware, or even library sets.</div>

            <li>Focused on the core purpose</li></ul>

        <div class="notes">A good functional prototype is as high fidelity as can reasonably be expected, but no more. It should be cheap, quick and easy to debug.

Focus must be kept on its core purpose, the phrase “while we’re at it, let’s just add X as well” doesn’t often lead to good prototypes as unforeseen  interactions between untested parts may end up taking time away from the actual purpose for which the prototype was created. For the same reason, it should not attempt to fit inside final enclosures or exactly represent final choices of components unrelated to the purpose of the prototype.</div>

        <h2>Technical Prototypes</h2>
        <ul><li>Focused on component interaction</li>
            <li>Final technical prototype may be production-ready</li>
            <li>Includes interactions such as

        <p><b>Support fundamentally affects choices in the earliest design phases.</b></p>
        <div class="notes">Development questions such as these only have their answer in the maintenance and support strategy for the system.

This, like everything else, must be specified and tested against as part of the core development procedure.

The inclusion of maintenance strategies in design specifications seems intuitive, however it’s often overlooked. Sometimes accidentally as the actual field failure of a product seems so far away from development. Sometimes intentionally as the client wishes to get something to the market, what happens when it gets there is seen as incidental.

Of course, what good is getting your foot in the door if the marketplace is going to react badly and cut it off?</div>
