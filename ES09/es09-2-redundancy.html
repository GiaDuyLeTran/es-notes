        <p>The Ariane 5 rocket is a heavy-lifting platform designed to move satellites in to low-earth or geostationary orbit.</p>
        <p>In 1996, after 37 seconds of flight, the maiden launch of this platform ended in a self-destruct of the system at a cost of over $300 Million.</p>

            <li>Shortly after launch, the inertial reference system crashed as a result of an input velocity that was too high</li>
            <li>This specification mistake was common across all three redundant systems, each failed in turn, the rocket become unstable and was ripped apart due to aerodynamic forces before exploding.</li></ul>

        <div class="notes">The software had explicitly removed the error checking in this part of the code to get better efficiency. It was deemed that input values that were too high were physically impossible (which they were for Ariane 4, just not 5).

        Worse, the actual piece of code that crashed wasn't even being used by the Ariane 5 platform, it was not needed.  I was not removed from the code only so the engineers didn't have to retest the whole software system.</div>

        <div class="notes">Distinct errors may be able to be recovered from, as failure can still be detected. Coindicent failures may make it look like the failure value is in fact correct and the failure may not be detected.

        Coincident failures involving more than two versions were never detected.

        The three- and five-version systems showed better failure rates than the single-version &ldquo;Gold Standard&rdquo; prepared by Honeywell.

        Having five independent systems designed in this fashion provides a failure rate 20x better than a single unit (though of course probably at 5x the cost).</div>

        By defining the program in terms of atomic actions, intermediate and error states are never seen from the outside. As such, the error value is contained inside the action.

        Firewalls can be employed to separate two domains (systems). Data can be held at the firewall until it has passed all checks.

        Assessment of the error is required by analyzing the location of the error and the possible paths of propagation both towards the error state and from it. The root cause of the error may not be able to be directly measured so the reverse paths from the error location must be analyzed in order to try and determine where the root fault might lie.

        The forward paths are analyzed as well in order to determine what effects the error may have had before the containment could be enacted.</div>
