        <h1>Definitions</h1>
        <p><b>Reliability</b>: How well a system conforms to its specification of behaviour</p>
        <p><b>Failure</b>: A deviation from that specification</p>
        <p><b>Error</b>: The internal problem that results in failure</p>
        <p><b>Fault</b>: The mechanical or algorithmic cause of the error</p>

        <p>If a subsystem fails, this can be a fault in the outer system.</p>

        <div class="notes">A failure is a deviation from specification of behaviour which is an external property. If something goes wrong inside a system but its behaviour doesn't change, then it is not a failure.

        This is important for reliability as it means that we can examine methods to identify and contain faults before they lead to an error and cause a system failure.</div>

        <h3>Transient</h3>

        In order to prevent faults, the system must be understood.

        <ul><li>Understand material properties</li>
            <li>Know boundary conditions on inputs, outputs</li>

        <h2>Fault Avoidance</h2>
        Prevent faults from entering the design and constructions.

        <ul><li>Use high-reliability components</li>
            <li>Use thoroughly tested methods and techniques for assembly and interconnect</li>
            <li>Package hardware to prevent external interference</li>
            <li>Rigorous/Formal specification of requirements and compliance procedures</li>
            <li>Use proven design methodologies</li>
            <li>Use standardised software and hardware engineering environments to manage complexity.</li></ul>

        <h2>Fault Removal</h2>
        Find and manage faults after construction but before operation.

        <h3>Production Fault Removal</h3>
        <p>A subset of fault removal procedures may be used on production units, not just during the design phase.</p>

        <div style="float:left;width:400px"><h3>PCB Test Tag</h3>
            <p>A portion of the PCB with a special pattern on it. Snapped off the main PCB and saved for future reference if that board should develop a fault.</p></div>

        <h1>Fault Tolerance</h1>
        <p>Removal isn't completely effective:</p>
        <p><ul><li>Testing can never be exhaustive</li>
            <li>Test environments are not completely realistic</li>
            <li>Specification may not be correct</li>
            <li>Faults may develop at run-time anyway</li></ul></p>

        <p><b>Fault Tolerance</b> is the concept of providing controlled behaviour in the face of unpredicted fault.</p>

        <div class="notes">Failures are only defined with respect to the specification. Fault removal must therefore work with respect to the specification.  It may not be until the system becomes operational that a deviation between the specification and the real system is detected and in that case, the system may be required to continue to operate (or at least fail safely).

        Of course there is always the likelihood of faults developing in the field. For example, part damage.</div>

        <h3>Important For</h3>
        Systems that are:
        <p><ul><li>Remote</li>
            <li>Unmanned</li>
            <li>Inaccessible&hellip;</li></ul></p>

        <h3>Full Tolerance</h3>
        <p>System continues to function without failure. System parameters (e.g. lifetime) may be affected.</p>

        <h3>Fail-Soft</h3>
        Graceful Degredation. The system continues to operate in the face of all &ldquo;foreseeable&rdquo; fault conditions, accepting a reduction in functionality or performance.

        <h3>Fail-Safe</h3>
        System shuts down safely at fault. Can be thought of as fail-soft degredation to zero functionality.

        <div class="notes">The level of fault tolerance required will depend on the Embedded System.  Many systems will request full fault tolerance but will accept graceful degredation.  For example, Rovers on Mars often have a single wheel fail. This subsystem failure is a fault for the rover as a whole with graceful degredation to slower movement.</div>

        <h2>Tolerance by Redundancy</h2>
        <p>Redundancy may be used in order to</p>
        <p><ul><li>Detect faults early</li>
            <li>Handle exceptional situations</li>
            <li>Functional replacements for entire failed (sub-)systems.</li></ul></p>

        <h2>Other Methods</h2>
        <ul><li>Watchdog Timer: Detects when a hardware device hasn't &ldquo;checked in&rdquo; for some time and restarts it.</li>
            <li>Limit Switch: Physically detect mechanical drive issues such as an actuator being instructed to move past its capabilities.</li>
            <li>Redundant Sensors: Provide sanity checks for each other</li>
            <li>Transient Recording Systems: &ldquo;Black Box&rdquo; that at least allows failure analysis and hopefully prevention of future occurances</li>
