        <h1>Processor Features</h1>
        <div class="notes">In order to get the best possible performance, microprocessors may make extensive use of features like
<ul><li>Branch Prediction</li>
<li>Caching</li>
<li>Frequency Scaling</li>
<li>Pipelining</li></ul>
All of these, and more, will effect the real time response of the processor.
If there’s only one ‘thread’ of execution then many of the following effects are greatly reduced. We will define a thread of execution simply as a piece of code executed asynchronously with respect to another. In this way, threads include interrupt and exception handlers so single-threaded execution is actually very rare, even on the smallest of processors.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="step point" data-x-rel="500" data-y-rel="-100" data-scale="0.5">
        A microprocessor is a collection of logic gates and therefore is <b>deterministic in nature</b>. Indeterminism comes from <b>coupling</b> the response time of the processor to unknown or unknowable influences.

        <div class="rarrow-m-h" style="float:left;width:50px;margin-left:80px;margin-top:70px;"></div>
        <div class="notes">Pipelining introduces dependencies between successive instructions (which may be from different threads of execution). This is not a problem if every instruction takes the same amount of time to execute, but if one instruction stalls, then those behind it stall as well.

A stall could be due to a floating point computation (execution time may be dependent on the actual data value), branch misprediction, cache miss or a number of other inter-instruction dependencies.</div>

        <div class="rarrow-m-h" style="float:left;width:50px;margin-left:80px;margin-top:50px;"></div>
        <div class="notes">When ever the processor encounters an ‘if’ construct (including things like ‘stop looping if’), it attempts to guess the answer and starts executing one branch before the outcome is actually known.

This speeds up the case where the processor guesses correctly, but if the processor guesses incorrectly there’s a some amount of time (and energy) spent doing the wrong thing. Branch prediction is generally deterministic if you look hard enough, but can couple different subsystems in unexpected ways. For example, the run time of Thread 1 can be affected by the way Thread 2 has conditioned the branch predictor.</div>

        <div class="notes">The processor keeps a ‘cache’ of commonly used (in practice, usually <b>recently used</b>) data somewhere it can get quick access. Like the previous items, this introduces timing dependencies between seemingly unrelated pieces of code. For example, being interrupted for a short time by a thread that uses lots of data may be more harmful than being interrupted for a long time by a thread that doesn’t touch much data (and therefore many cache lines).

It’s often stated that interrupts must be fast in order to have minimal impact on other processes. More generally, they should be deterministic in their execution time. Rarely would you find an interrupt specified in terms of its data access patterns but you should!</div>

        <div class="notes">The previous items could, theoretically, be perfectly modeled. If all the running tasks are deterministic then there’s no problem; the problem they present is that it becomes hard to analyze the interaction between tasks, and to decouple real time and non-RT tasks.

Frequency Scaling cannot be modeled based on knowledge of the processor and software package alone. As the name suggests, this feature changes the speed of execution based upon the physical parameters of the processor. If the processor can be clocked faster without physical damage, it is.</div>

        <div class="notes">How do FPGAs compare to microcontrollers in terms of determinism and real time performance?
FPGAs do have an intrinsic advantage over microprocessors in terms of determinism as unrelated tasks are performed in physically separate places so there is not necessarily any conflict for resources nor coupling between unrelated pieces of code.

If your FPGA design includes some shared resource and an associated arbitration algorithm (memory, radio modem etc.) then you start introducing couplings and associated non-determinism. These interconnections are very explicit though, and relatively easy to audit.</div>

following questions can be asked:
•  Is the right thing going to happen (liveness)
•  Is the wrong thing not going to happen (safety)

The property of liveness is that of progress; if a program has to wait for an event (resource), will that event (resource) eventually come? This is a key concept when scheduling resources that have to be used by several threads (including the CPU itself) and will be revisited during discussions of operating systems.

Safety is less subtle. Simply, do all failure modes lead to something safe happening over something bad (controlled shutdown, self destruct...).</div>
