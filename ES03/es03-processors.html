Before the 1970s, all computers were of CISC type. Memory was the supremely limited resource of the time, hardware wasn’t so much of a problem, so the focus was on packing the maximum amount of complexity in to the minimum number of instructions.

Memory is now relatively cheap and the focus has moved to performance. This favours the RISC style as simpler instructions are faster to execute</div>

        <div class="notes">Since the quantum shift from CISC to RISC styles in the 1970’s, the
industry has been slowly incorporating more and more CISC-style functionality in order to reduce the number of instructions executed.

This only works if the newly introduced instructions are still fast to execute. A simple example of this is single-instruction floating point operations which, by any definition, are complex operations but may be supported by dedicated FPU hardware to keep the speed up and make them fit the RISC paradigm.</div>

        <h3>Decomposition</h3>
        <p>Splitting complex instructions in to simple ones before execution.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="notes">Another option for hybrid designs are processors that never really
moved out of the CISC era. x86 instructions are CISC in nature, however they’re executed in a RISC core.

This is done through “microinstructions” (aka microoperations, uops). The processor fetches several instructions from memory per clock cycle and dynamically translates these in to a sequence of uops. The uops are executed, potentially in parallel, then their results are re-assembled on the other side. This introduces significant extra complexity to a fully-RISC solution but maintains backwards compatibility with existing code and can actually provide the best of both worlds: Minimum program memory footprint combined with fast, pipelined execution.</div>

        <div class="notes">The core observation of pipelining is this: Each instruction must take five clock cycles to complete, but you may execute more than one instruction at a time!
By breaking each instruction in to exactly the same number of pieces like this, each section of the processor can be fully utilized at every point in time.

Why keep the ME or WB stages for instructions that don’t need them? Because keeping instructions
the same as each each other, they can be pipelined and the overall utilization increases significantly.</div>

        <div class="notes">The Decode stage is where data from the register file is loaded in to the ALU, but what if the output of one instruction is the input for the subsequent one? In the above example, the SUB instruction has to stall at the decode stage for three extra clock cycles before the write back of the ADD has updated the register.</div>

        </div>

        <div class="notes">The solution is Operand Forwarding, where the control path logic recognizes the potential for a stall and “short circuits” the result from the output of the EX stage back to its input ready for the SUB, without waiting for the whole write back/decode read cycle.

This is a hardware solution, but if the hardware budget it tight, there’s a software solution: Get the compiler to re-order instructions and make sure the dependent instructions are never in the pipeline together. You don’t get the result faster, but at least you don’t waste the intermediate cycles.</div>

        <div class="notes">If one of the instructions is a branch instruction, it will render any instructions that have already been fetched and/or partially executed irrelevant. The penalty of this depends on how late in the pipeline the CPU can determine whether or not the branch is taken.

In the example above, the branch condition is tested at Execute time so the decoded instruction after it, and the fetched instruction after that, have to be removed from the pipeline.</div>

        <div class="notes">Branch Delay Slot. The one or two instructions immediately following a branch are always executed. If there is useful work that can be done that doesn’t affect the outcome of the branch, it can be inserted in to this slot. If there isn’t any work, the compiler must insert NOP instructions.

The second solution (well, attempt at mitigation), is Branch Prediction. BP is implemented on almost all modern medium and large processors and the effectiveness of the BP algorithm is often a key determinant of overall performance.

Lastly, most compilers will try and work out which branch is going to be taken most often and arrange the code such that this is the fast path through the pipeline.</div>

        <h1>Pipeline Depth</h1>
        Deep pipelines can improve throughput but all the previous hazards increase in frequency and severity.
        <div class="notes">The five-stage model for instruction execution, or something close, is often found implemented in RISC processors however it isn’t the only type of pipeline.

An N-stage pipeline can theoretically improve throughput N-times, so deeper pipelines should have better performance. In practice, long pipelines with many instructions executing simultaneously introduce more possibility of data interdependence and higher likelihood of stalls.

Moreover, the branch penalty increases the further in to the pipeline the branch outcome is decided. Despite this, some later Pentium 4 processors had pipelines 31 stages deep. In highly constrained devices, such as network packet processors, the pipelines may be several thousand stages deep.</div>

        Multiple instructions can be issued at once so long as they use independent hardware blocks.

        <div class="notes">We have previously shown that many instructions either require the
ALU or memory access but not both. For example, a direct-addressed load requires no computation and an add involving only registers requires no memory.

Processors can exploit this in order to process more than one instruction per clock cycle. This is termed Superscalar Operation. Below is shown a section of a Superscalar pipeline with two execution units, however there may be other units to cover FPU operation, single-cycle multiply or other such operations.</div>
