        <div class="notes">Systems interfaces includes things you would expect, the box has to be able to receive the digital video signal, a remote control signal and output some standard format for display on a Television (DVB, HDMI, IrDA).
The device might have functions outside its core role, such as a web interface (HTTP) or email notifications (SMTP) which in turn build on top of other standards (Ethernet/TCP/UDP/IP/802.11)
The systems interfaces also have to cover interfaces to the software as well. The ability for your Embedded System to run the target software package is just as important as any other aspect of interfacing.</div>

        <h1>Interfaces  <>  Conventions</h1>
        <center><img src="images/architecture/uiface.png"/></center>
        <div class="notes">Clearly most interfaces in a typical Embedded System interfaces can be implemented against a known standard. This usually speeds up development and improves reliability as reference implementations and test benches are often parts of the standard
themselves and not something that has to be implemented from scratch.
If there isn’t an applicable standard, there are often at least standard conventions. Graphical User Interfaces are an example – the notion of icons and windows as interaction metaphors has proven to scale from the Apple computers of old to the latest touchscreen enabled devices.</div>

        <h1>When Not to Standardize</h1>

        <h3>Market Forces</h3>
        <ul><li>Lock your ecosystem</li>

            <li>Device limitations</li>
            <li>Special/specific use</li></ul></div>

        <div class="notes">When not to standardize: When the boss tells you not to! The most
typical case for not adhering to some standard protocol is that the market forces are such that interfaces must remain proprietary.
The use of proprietary standards is decreasing as companies realize that interoperability is generally desirable after all, but also that if you close an interface there are plenty of people out there interested in opening it back up. The Microsoft SMB file sharing protocol is one such example, where Andrew Tridgell (now at the ANU) reverse engineered the protocol from scratch, was sued by Microsoft but prevailed in the courts. Simply, it’s often not worth the extra time required to lock down an interface.
Time to market can perhaps be improved by not adhering to a standard in some cases. The risk often increases though.
There can be technical reasons not to standardize, but fewer than you might think. Any device-specific interfaces will at least generally be built on top of commonly specified ones.

        <div class="notes">Network interfaces extend the Embedded System architecture beyond the
physical system itself. The devices may be connected in a Client/Server fashion or a Peer-to-Peer manor.

These are extremes where every device can talk to every other (P2P) or every device can only talk to one (C/S). There are intermediates such as Mesh networks where each device can talk to a subset of others.

This simple distinction is useful for most standards though.</div>

        The full OSI model is rarely implemented by seven individual pieces of code. Most implementations will combine levels. TCP/IP, or the "internet stack" if you like, implements only four levels.

The application is responsible for data formatting and session tracking.

Transport is done by TCP or friends (e.g. UDP).

Logical addressing (network layer) is done by IP.

Network access, including physical routing, is done by the network card</div>

        <div class="notes">
        Bluetooth groups layers for standardization. The Application Group is specified by service (audio device, data device etc).  The Middleware group is often TCP/IP, though this is overkill as Bluetooth doesn't/can't use many of the full features of this stack.  The transport protocol group is the part that would commonly be thought of as "Bluetooth": The wireless stuff.

This is an example of a protocol at a low level also forcing some structure on the laters above. We will see this pattern again in future lectures.</div>
