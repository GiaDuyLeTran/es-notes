        <div class="notes">The architecture of an Embedded System is often thought to contain
hardware and hardware interfaces only. Certainly this is the portion of
the Embedded System that is typically given to Electronic Engineers to
design.
Embedded Systems must interact closely with their environment, so the
correct definition and specification of interfaces is certainly of great
importance.

Embedded Systems typically have stricter constraints on power
consumption, space, performance any many other attributes that can’t
be described by the hardware alone.
The software stack forms an integral part of the overall systems
architecture and must certainly be considered when designing the
system.

The interface with the environment is obvious for sensors and actuators.  It must also be considered for reliability and usage specifications (will it be used in water? Is it expected to be in reach of a child?).

A more subtle interface with the environment affects every part of the design: The interface with time. This will be covered extensively in future lectures.

The tight constraints surrounding Embedded Systems don’t stop at
physical parameters.
The successful design of an Embedded System has to note the fact
that such systems are commodities, but also that they are rarely sold
as a final product.
An Embedded System architecture has to recognize the interfaces
between the system and the business processes around it, not just the
physical processes.

        <div style="clear:both">Assumed a narrow definition of <b>Interference</b> (specification too general).</div>

        <div class="notes">Here we have a (very small) subset of a high level architecture diagram for an embedded system along with the specifications relevant to each
other.

The unwanted interaction between systems was all originally specified as “Interference” which was interpreted as electromagnetic radiation effects. In fact there was a physical coupling between the systems - the power components had large inductors that, when placed near the antennae, detuned them significantly.  This wasn’t discovered until late in the design cycle.

The interface specification must cover all types of interaction, not just the <b>intended</b> interaction.

It is uncommon for any one person to get this right. Some companies keep their master specification formats a trade secret. For the rest of us, there are often open specifications generated by industry groups that will help.</div>
