        <div class="notes">We will assume that the architecture work has been done and that the devices on the board have their drivers written. We will examine what might have to be done to write a Board Support Package (BSP). A BSP is a selection of code and other binary or plain text files that describe the operation of a particular board to the kernel. The BSP should also include board documentation, build environment and userspace code required to operate the board such as the graphical environment. That stuff is boring (but necessary), we will examine only the kernel portion of the BSP.

        <div class="notes">Some devices also require that the kernel load firmware in to them before they can operate. We will lump firmware configuration in with the drivers here.

We will ignore devices that can be automatically detected (USB devices for example) and focus only on describing parts that are connected in ways that can’t be automatically detected.</div>

        <div class="notes">The concept of a BSP is unusual to people who are used to building their own x86-based computers. In those machines, you can connect anything where ever it fits and at the next boot, the hardware should be automatically detected.

This is true for two reasons:
1. The BIOS on the motherboard is preloaded with information regarding the board itself. Stock-standard code can be used in the kernel to read and act on this (through commands called ACPI commands)
2. All the busses within an x86 computer (SATA, PCIe, USB etc.) have functionality to probe locations and/or to auto-detect device arrival and removal.

It hasn’t always been true. Anyone ever fit an ISA card?

The address and interrupt number of each card had to be manually selected by means of jumpers on the boards. If it was incorrectly configured, the system would crash. Modern busses such as PCI either have dedicated resources for each physical slot, or some sort of arbitration and control algorithm to assign unique resources to each device at boot time.</div>

        <div class="notes">The third option for describing a particular board is to write C code that exactly describes that board and compile it in to the kernel. This is the way that most embedded systems have traditionally been described as it’s simple and efficient.

It has the significant down side that you have to completely recompile the kernel each time you add a new device to your board. It also leads to significant bloat of the source tree as you have to keep code describing every variation of every board that has ever been supported by the kernel.

You need one of these snippets for every device on the board! At least, every device that can’t be automatically detected.</div>
