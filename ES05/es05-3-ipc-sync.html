        <h1>Communication<br/>&#8597;<br/>Synchronization</h1>
        <div class="notes">Threads (and their extension, tasks) have been introduced as a container for scheduling, in that a thread is a set of actions whose execution time can be controlled by a scheduler.

Scheduling has in turn been presented as a way to enfore real-time constraints at runtime, rather than having to prove every aspect of a system off-line (a process that may be hard or impossible).

It's rare that the actions in every thread are completely independent of each other. We will now examine how threads and tasks can exchange information safely.

For the purposes of Real-time Embedded Systems, inter-thread communication and synchronization are tightly related; they will be examined together.</div>

This implies that the scheduler must know about pipes, or at least about the blocking and unblocking events.</div>

        <div class="notes">The requirement that signal types be predefined is restrictive, however there are some "user defined" types.  For example, the <code>dd</code> program under Linux prints out statistics if it receives <code>SIGUSR1</code>.

Some signals can be blocked by the receiving application, some will always be delivered.  An example of the latter is the <code>SIGKILL</code> signal that causes a program to force quit.

Asynchronous delivery means that the receiving program doesn't have to be actively listening for the signal.  In this way, they are a lot like interrupts.</div>

        The sender may or may not know whether the signal was delivered depending on signal type.<br/>
        The receiver is notified of arrival asynchronously. This may or may not be desirable.<br/>
        Signals may or may not <b>queue</b>, meaning that a signal sent before a previous one is delivered may be lost.
        
        <div class="notes">Asynchronous delivery means that a program may immediately respond to the signal event. On the other hand, if the signal is used (for example) to notify a program of new data being available, there is no guarantee that the receiving program is in a position to actually process it.</div>

<b>Note</b> that the ordering of ASM instructions shown is just one possibility, chosen to demonstrate potential problems. If this code were to actually be executed, the "preemption points", the times at which the scheduler switches from one thread to another, will be slightly different and may or may not cause a problem.

Of course, "may not cause a problem" is not good enough.</div>
